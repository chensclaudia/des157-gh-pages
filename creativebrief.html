  <h2>Background/Overview</h2>



      <p> One of the most impactful aspects of our lives is food. It brings communities together and
brings us a great deal of happiness. Although it seems many of us have our love of food in
common, it’s still only shared amongst tight-groups. We all dread the awkward first date
dinners especially compared to a night out with a group of friends we haven’t seen in a while.
There’s a ton of dishes we all have yet to explore, thus missing out on. It’s also not readily
available to everyone when they want it/need it. We aim to change these things.</p>
  
  <h2>Objective</h2>
  
  <p>To bring together communities and enrich each others’ lives with different accessible dishes.</p>
  
  <h2>Target Audience</h2>
  
  <p>University students, specifically UCD students. Ones who are eager to explore and engage with
their peers through food. Students in circumstances where food isn’t easily accessible or
students who are willing to share new dishes/leftovers. </p>
  
  <h2>Big Idea</h2>
  <p>Bringing all kinds of people together with all kinds of food.</p>
  
  <h2>Impact</h2>
  <p>We have all hit rough patches in our lives. From rationing ramen everyday to studying so late
into the night buying or making food is just too exhausting. Or we’re just tired of eating the
same thing everyday but we don’t have the knowledge to make anything better. We can enrich
each other’s lives by sharing and introducing to each other new food. </p>
