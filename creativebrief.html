      <p> I enjoyed creating these data visualizations. I wanted to create the most complete picture of what it was like
        to work at IBM as possible. For some pieces of data (like the first chart) I couldn't provide an explanation
        for why the data was the way it is, but for others I could provide more insight. Of course this is very far to how
        IBM workers are actually like, (how well can we all be represented in parcels of information?), but it is still
        interesting to see this data and make our own observations.
