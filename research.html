  <h1>Background Research</h1>
  <p>My subject is connectivity. Connecting people through shared snippets of their daily lives. Somewhat like Instagram’s Explore Page, how its algorithm links us to content similar to that we’ve previously shown an interest in or users we share mutual friends with. I aim to connect people in a similar manner, in order to show each other we’re not so different, and that ultimately we can celebrate our similarities and differences as making us unique. I aim to cultivate a space where understanding can be reached. </p>

We live in a technological but environmentally decaying age. Everything is being digitalized now. There is even digitalized paper now. That’s right paper you can write on and it immediately gets sent to the nearest smart device. The Internet of Things’s goal is to have every piece of technology that can be off or on share a network. This can sound a bit scary, I don’t need my toaster to be connected to my alarm and know when I get up and go to bed, but this can also has its benefits. If you left your oven on and left home, if it’s connected to your car it can realize you’re gone and turn itself off. Or if your alarm is connected to your kettle, your kettle can begin heating water for your morning tea (Morgan, 2017). We can be quite vindictive towards technology’s advancements, but it definitely does have its advantages. As we go out the door today, we can tell Siri to send a text to our friends to wish them luck on their exams, or set a note to remember to a loved one’s interests the next time we have to gift shopping. This extra bit of care we are able to go through because of technology parallels the feelings of unity I want my project to create.

Despite the talk of letting our coffee maker and digital planner mingle, we still lack technologically in other aspects, such as transportation. Means of transportation are quite limited in California. For example, going from NorCal to SoCal is either a taxing car ride or an expensive flight. A bus ride is also incredibly draining. HyperLoop is a vacuum pod coined by billionaire Elon Musk to revolutionize transportation. It hopes to make this cross California trip in a mere 30 minutes (Nicol, 2017). Imagine the opportunities. Planes allowed us to see our loved ones from across the world in a reasonable manner (I mean before this it was a long boat ride). HyperLoop stations are being planned across the globe, hopefully making a way for people who connect through my project to interact in person some day.

Education has also taken a digitalized form. My personal hero, Salman Khan, has devoted his life to his free one world schoolhouse that has positively transformed the lives of many. People from around the world have access to an education that once seemed far away. It is learning in a very personal manner (Tucker, 2018). Although it seems more isolating to learn by yourself with Khan Academy, education is freedom. Education opens doors to opportunities many couldn’t dream of. We are all connected through our mutual struggle, even if it’s through something mundane like a difficult calculus problem, or a seemingly impossible coding bug. We come together to help each other more than we think. This kind of community is the kind I want to foster. The one where we can look to each other in our successes, and our struggles.
