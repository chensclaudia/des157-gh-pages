    Our first tester was Iris Xie. she really enjoyed the graphical elements of our project. She thought it had a good look, cute icons, and nice color scheme. She would've liked it more had we adhered to a grid system, since our overlays were not the same
    size. She suggested to resize images to fit our grid. She also suggested to make it user-responsive. She was a bit confused on the exact purpose of our website, and suggested we integrate an About page somewhere on the site. She recommended some more
    resources that we can add to our page like CalFresh, EBT, and Davis Fruit Tree. She suggested we use Firebase to hold store data users input. She also suggested that we should think critically of how we want to implement the posts page of our website
    because many times posts can become redundant or forgotten about. More feedback included short descriptions underneath our resource icons and to have resources specifically for underprivileged communities (single parents, low-income students).

    Our next tester was also a woman named Iris, Iris Z. She really enjoyed or idea, however she was a bit disappointed/confused on the lack of a map. She also believes the graphic elements of our website are strong. She recommended different labels or different
    colors for different foods. Most of her feedback correlated with Iris X's.

    Our last tester was chuck. He was very confused on the purpose of our project, and strongly recommended an About page. He recommended integrating the About page with our map, like text above or below the map introducing the audience to the website. He
    also enjoyed the aesthetic elements of our page and the simplicity of it </p>
